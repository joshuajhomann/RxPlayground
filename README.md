# RXPlayground

This is the demo project for the Saturday April 26, 2019 **Intro to RxSwift** Flock of Swifts meetup at the Eureka building in Irvine, CA.

The *Starter* folder contains the project we will be working on.

The *Final* folder will contain the completed app.

We will explore 3 cases:
- Creating a `Observable` timer to explore memory management, subscription and observation on different queues, and ui binding.
- A an observable Spirograph ViewController to explore `ControlProperty` and how to combine several `Observable`s
- A search ViewController to explore how RxSwift's operators can simplify the canonical example of a rate limited type as you search network request.
